PAbFold (Peptide-AntiBody AlphaFold2) is a pipeline centered around AlphaFold2 for predicting both how well an antigen:antibody pair might interact with one another, an where the epitope subsequence is in the antigen. I welcome you to read our paper:  https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.04.19.590298v1

An antibody sequence should first be converted to a single chain variable fragment (scFv) to drastically reduce the computational requirements (therefore time) needed (#Fig A#).
